# someguy171's Guide to a new Windows 10 PC
New to PC gaming, or Windows 10 in general?

This guide will go through important information about a computer, the best apps to download, and the ways that game settings can affect performance. There is also some starting guidance if you want to record YouTube videos or stream to Twitch.

Although it is advised that you read through the guide at your own pace to understand and learn how to use your PC in the best way possible, only some steps require actual action. These are signified by a * in the table of contents.

# Section 1 - The most important bits

## Important parts of a computer

Below are the most important components of a computer. If you ask for help in #üíªtech-support, you'll likely be asked for the names of some of these components.
Have them ready on a cheat sheet, or (even better) memorise them, even if you have no idea what they mean.

Component | Purpose and features
--------- | --------------------
**CPU** | The Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer. Your CPU power is especially important in open world games.
**RAM** | Random Access Memory stores programs that are currently being used. Having more RAM will allow you to have more apps open, like a game + music app + video app + Discord + more, without impacting general performance.
**GPU** | The Graphics Processing Unit handles visuals. Your GPU is the most influential for performance in PC games.
**VRAM** | Video RAM is a part of the GPU, and stores image data. Your GPU has a finite amount of it, so don't increase graphics settings past its maximum capacity.
**Motherboard** | The body of the PC. All other components are seated on or are connected to the "mobo."
**Monitor** | The screen that connects to your GPU in the PC. Usually 60Hz (fps), but can be 120Hz or 144Hz.

If you want to find out these parts' names, specs or details, use CPU-Z (in [Other apps](#other-apps)).

## Important features and shortcuts
Windows 10 uses many default apps that are essential for navigation, organisation and setup. When I refer to these apps in the guide, look for the icon shown in the image below.

![winapps](https://i.imgur.com/qI8nk5a.png)

There are also some basic features in Windows 10 to know about:

- Taskbar
  - The bar at the bottom. In the centre are the pinned apps. Pin apps by dragging them from File Explorer or the Desktop straight on top of the Taskbar.
- Start Menu
  - Access the Start Menu by pressing the Windows icon on the left of taskbar, where you can search for programs and files.
- Notification centre
  - View your internet settings, time/date, and notifications on the right of the taskbar.
- Auto-scroll
  - Middle-click to enable auto-scroll; move your mouse up and down to quickly glide through pages.
- Side buttons
  - Most gaming mice have side buttons. Use these to navigate forward or backwards in web browsers.

There are also some essential shortcuts to get used to:

Shortcut | Function
-------- | --------
Ctrl + C | Copies whatever is selected to the clipboard.
Ctrl + V | Pastes whatever has been copied.
Ctrl + Z | Undo.
Alt + Tab | Cycles through apps. Press and hold Alt, and continuously press Tab to select a new app. Let go of Alt to open the app.
CapsLock | Inverts typing; all keys will become capital, and Shift + letter will type lower-case.
Fn + Fx | At the top of the keyboard, there are many keys, each with F(number). If they have icons under them, hold Fn and press the key to use this function. (e.g. ‚èØÔ∏é under F11 means Fn + F11 pauses/plays music)
Alt + F4 | Closes the active app. (**Don't get fooled into using this in online games!**)

## Initial admin

Go to **Settings**, Update & Security, Windows Update, and select `Check for Updates`. Wait for the updates to download, and restart your PC as many times as needed.

Go to **Settings**, System, Display. Make sure your display resolution is good, and change your settings as needed if you have multiple monitors.

## 144Hz monitor

A **144Hz monitor** will refresh 144 times every second, allowing for smoother visuals.
Although HDMI 1.4 can support 144Hz, it will often cap at 120Hz. To take advantage of your monitor fully, use **DisplayPort**.

If you do not have a 144Hz monitor, you can skip this section.

Go to **Settings**, System, Display, and select `Advanced display settings`.
Choose your main display (the 144Hz monitor), and make sure, next to `Refresh rate (Hz)`, it says `144Hz`.

If it doesn't say this, select `Display adaptor properties for Display 1`.
Navigate to the `Monitor` tab, and change the refesh rate to `144 Hertz`.
If this option is not available, you may need to [update your graphics drivers](#drivers).

## Two drives?

A **drive** is storage, either as a *hard drive* (spinning disc) or an *SSD* (electronic, no moving parts). They appear in File Explorer with a unique icon, and their names will have a drive letter - for example, (C:) or (D:).

If you only have one drive, you can skip this section.

If you have an SSD for Windows, and another drive for extra storage, you'll want to clear as much space on the Windows drive as possible. While programs benefit greatly from the increased speed of a solid state drive, files generally don't. Keeping folders like Documents and Downloads on your SSD will take up too much space with little benefit.

1. In **File Explorer**, navigate to `This PC` on the left-hand sidebar.
2. Right click the `Desktop` folder, and select `Properties`.
3. Navigate to the `Location` tab, and select `Move...`.
4. Select your hard drive. Your SSD will likely have a small Windows icon beside it, while the HDD does not.
5. Right click in any blank space, hover over `New`, and select `Folder`.
6. Name the folder what you're moving. In this case, rename it to `Desktop`. Be sure to capitalise properly.
7. Select the newly made folder, and select `Select Folder`.
8. Select `Apply`, then `Yes` in the window that pops up.
9. Wait until the folder has successfully moved, then press `OK`.

Repeat the above steps for all folders in the `This PC` section:

* `3D Objects`
* `Desktop`
* `Documents`
* `Downloads`
* `Music`
* `Pictures`
* `Videos`

Be sure to rename the new folder (in step 6) correctly for each folder you're moving.

# Section 2 - Downloading important things

## Downloading programs
Download the correct version, 32 bit or 64 bit.

Not sure which to download? 

Go to **Settings**, System, About. Under `Device specifications`, `System type`, your architecture will be shown.

View this image to see how to safely download programs:

## Drivers

In basic terms, **drivers** are programs that allow your devices to work properly and effectively with Windows 10 and your programs/games. They are essential, especially if you want your PC to run new games well.

For gamers, the most important driver is your GPU driver, or **Graphics Drivers**.

1. Open **Nvidia Experience**.
2. Navigate to the `DRIVERS` tab.
3. Select `DOWNLOAD`.
4. Once it has downloaded, select `EXPRESS INSTALLATION`.
5. Wait until it has finished installing. Do not use your PC during this time.
6. Once it has finished, restart your PC.

Check Nvidia Experience every few weeks for a new driver. Sometimes, games will run much worse if you aren't on the most recent driver.

# Section 3 - The extra few steps

## Extensions for Firefox

Extensions are like add-ons. They add extra features to your browser / sites.

Extension name | Function
-------------- | --------

- **Spotify**
  - Settings, Show Advanced Settings, turn off **Hardware Acceleration**

# Section 4 - Game settings

## DPI and Sensitivity

**DPI**, or Dots Per Inch, is a hardware value for your mouse that changes how accurate it is. If you have a gaming mouse, it will have a DPI button that cycles through its pre-made DPI levels.

**Sensitivity**, or 'sens' (pronounced sense), is the in-game speed of your mouse. In general, it's best to leave your DPI the same and change your sensitivity in the game.

## Game settings - what do they mean?

Unlike console, PC games allow you to fine tune your gaming experience. Most games will have presets, like "Medium" or "Ultra," but you can also edit each setting to play exactly how you want. Some impact performance a lot, so its good to know what each one does to balance pretty visuals and decent framerate.

Setting | What it does, impact on performance
------- | -----------------------------------
**Window setting** | Windowed (worst) is a regular window, like a browser. Fullscreen (best) maximises the resolution to fit your screen. Borderless Windowed (equal to fullscreen) looks like Fullscreen, but allows you to move the mouse out of the game.
**Resolution** | The number of pixels. Most monitors have 1920x1080 resolution. The lower the resolution, the worse the game will look, but the better it will run.
**Framerate** | The number of times the screen refreshes every second. 60fps (frames per second) is standard; anything more requires a specialised monitor. If your monitor only supports up to 60fps, cap the in-game FPS to 60 or 61 to reduce stress on GPU (no point in making it go higher if you can't see it!)
**Vsync** | If your framerate is less than your monitor's refresh rate (e.g. game running at 20fps, monitor is 60Hz), you will see the [screen tear](https://imgur.com/eAcmiFC). This happens because the top and bottom of the screen are not synced. If you are experiencing screen tearing, turn Vsync on. Otherwise, leave it off.
**Field of View** (FOV) | The angle, in degrees, that you can see. With a higher FOV, things in front of you will appear smaller, but you can see more to the left and right. Has no impact on performance, just personal preference.
**Motion blur** | Smears the edges of objects to accentuate camera movement. Leave this off - it drastically increases FPS.
**Global illumination** | Mimics how light bounces from one object to another. Turning it off increases FPS.
**Depth of Field** | Blurs objects that aren't in focus. Can be distracting, but doesn't impact FPS too much.
**SSAO/HBAO** | Adjusts lighting to calculate how much light falls on an object. Can have a decent impact on FPS.
**Anti-aliasing** | Blends colours and edges to mitigate the "jaggies" of diagonal lines. FXAA is fastest, but blurriest. MSAA is the most intelligent, but most taxing on FPS.
**Texture quality** | Controls resolution of all textures. Mostly taxing on VRAM.
**Texture filtering** | Reduces texture quality into the distance smoothly. It's old tech, so leave it at maximum and it still won't impact performance too much.

Any other settings may be specific to your game. Hover over / select them, and the game will likely tell you what it does. Some games will have a VRAM counter; make sure whatever you change doesn't make the counter go above its maximum. This can cause your game to crash.

# Section 5 - Making Videos and Streaming

## Disclaimer about streaming/recording

Recording any kind of footage can be extremely taxing on your PC, especially if you're streaming at 1080p, 60fps.
If you want to stream, and have a weaker build, you may need to decrease your in-game graphics settings, or be prepared to switch 720p or 30fps.

You will also need adequate internet speed to stream; using an ethernet cable is strongly reccomended for any online gaaming and/or streaming.

## Recording - Making content for YouTube

First, download [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), a free recording software.

Sources are where you get your inputs from. To set one up, right click in the empty `Sources` box, hover over `Add`, and select `Display Capture`. Enable `Create New`, and select `OK`. If you have multiple monitors, you can choose which monitor to capture. You can choose if you want to capture your cursor in the video too. Select `OK` when you're done. Your content will now capture everything on your screen.

To capture your Audio output, right click in the empty `Sources` box, hover over `Add`, and select `Audio Output Capture`. Select `OK`, and choose your output.

To capture your Audio input (your microphone), right click in the empty `Sources` box, hover over `Add`, and select `Audio Input Capture`. Select `OK`, and choose your input.

To begin recording, select `Start Recording`, and press it again (now `Stop Recording`) to end. Go to File, Settings, Output, Recording. Under Recording Path, select `Browse`. Here you can choose where OBS will save your video once you have finished recording.

Should you want to edit your video, you can use [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_lwks&view=download&Itemid=206). While complicated at first, Lightworks is a film-grade editing software that is free to use. Find tutoirals on YouTube to learn how to use it.
