# someguy171's Guide to a new Windows 10 PC
New to PC gaming, or Windows 10 in general? Here are some tips and tricks, essential programs to use, and general advice!

## Some general knowledge

Windows 10 uses many default apps that are essential for navigation, organisation and setup.

## First things first...
Go to Settings, Update & Security, Windows Update, and select `Check for Updates`. Wait for the updates to download, and restart your PC as many times as needed.

Go to Settings, System, Display. Make sure your display resolution is good, and change your settings as needed if you have multiple monitors.

## Have two drives?

A drive is storage, either as a hard drive (spinning disc) or an SSD (electronic, no moving parts). They appear in File Explorer with a unique icon, and their names will have a drive letter - for example, (C:) or (D:).

If you only have one drive, you can skip this section.

If you have an SSD for Windows, and another drive for extra storage, you'll want to clear as much space on the Windows drive as possible. While programs benefit greatly from the increased speed of a solid state drive, files generally don't. Keeping folders like Documents and Downloads on your SSD will take up too much space with little benefit.

1. In File Explorer, navigate to `This PC` on the left-hand sidebar.
2. Right click the `Desktop` folder, and select `Properties`.
3. Navigate to the `Location` tab, and select `Move...`.
4. Select your hard drive. Your SSD will likely have a small Windows icon beside it, while the HDD does not.
5. Right click in any blank space, hover over `New`, and select `Folder`.
6. Name the folder what you're moving. In this case, rename it to `Desktop`. Be sure to capitalise properly.
7. Select the newly made folder, and select `Select Folder`.
8. Select `Apply`, then `Yes` in the window that pops up.
9. Wait until the folder haas successfully moved, then press `OK`.

Repeat the above steps for all folders in the `This PC` section:

* `3D Objects`
* `Desktop`
* `Documents`
* `Downloads`
* `Music`
* `Pictures`
* `Videos`

Be sure to rename the new folder (in step 6) correctly for each folder you're moving.

## Downloading programs
Download the correct version, 32 bit or 64 bit. If you're not sure which to download, check Settings, System, About. Under Device specifications, System type, your architecture will be shown.
